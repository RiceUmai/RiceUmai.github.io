# Hello Jekyll Post

To apply a theme in Jekyll, you need to follow these general steps:

* Choose a theme: You can choose a theme from the official Jekyll theme gallery or from third-party websites.

* Download or clone the theme: Once you have selected a theme, you need to download or clone its repository to your local machine.

* Copy the theme files to your Jekyll project: Copy the theme files from the downloaded/cloned repository to the _layouts, _includes, _sass, and assets folders in your Jekyll project.

* Modify the _config.yml file: Modify the _config.yml file to include the name of the theme and any other necessary configuration options.

* Customize the theme: If you want to customize the theme, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the theme folders.

* Preview the changes: Preview the changes by running your Jekyll project locally using the jekyll serve command. You should see the theme applied to your site.

* Deploy the site: Once you are satisfied with the changes, deploy your site to your hosting provider.

Note: These steps may vary depending on the specific theme you choose and your Jekyll setup. Be sure to consult the theme documentation for specific instructions.
